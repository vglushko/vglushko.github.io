All solutions that contain custom XML markup will have to be revised. Many of the scenarios that are implemented by using custom XML markup can be implemented by using alternative technologies that are available in Word 2013. These technologies include content controls, form fields, and bookmarks.

These arbitrary values can be used to assign semantic meaning to parts of your content.
