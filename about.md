My name is Vitaliy. I have been working as a consultant in software development. My experience is in web development, cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, and some GCP), and IoT integrations. However, I am always trying something new here and there to push the limits. In most cases in my career, I provided my support from the early beginning of the projects and sometimes to their sunset, from the requirement gathering, technical idea, and development to deployment and maintenance.

It is my blog about software development, architecture, and related stuff. I write here about different ideas, solutions, and tricks I find while reading, coding, designing, or working on architecture.
