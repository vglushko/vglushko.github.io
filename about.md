My name is Vitaliy. For more than 20 years I am working as a consultant in software development. My experience is mostly in the web development, cloud infrastructure (mostly AWS, some Azure, and few GCP) and occasional IoT integrations. However, I am always trying something new here and there to push the limits. In the majority of the cases in my carrier I provided my support from the early beginning of the projects and sometimes to their sunset, from the requirement gathering, technical idea, and development to deployemnt and maintenance.

This is the my personal blog about software development, architecture and related stuff. I write here about anything related to software development that I find interesting while coding, desiging or architecturing.
